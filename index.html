        <h style="color:orange"> Kabuki </h> 
        <p> Kabuki was a design project created in 2016.</p> 
        <p> I was asked to create possible magazine covers for a cosmetic company. I played around a lot with contrast and light reflection. This bought a lot of focus to the skin and minimal makeup used on the model. </p>
        <p> Kabuki wanted the make up to be as natural as possible, while using bold colours in unconventional places. </p>

<div id="fresher_des2">
    <p> The Fresher Project aimed to capture the life of a Wellington University Student in an authentic way. The shots seemd to capture the transition between child and adult life, with novelties like wine, cigarettes and coffee now consumed without restriction. </p>

<p> My work in Public Relations is new but most of what I enjoy most. It mixes together my passion for design, writing and advocacy, which always results in a project i'm proud of.</p> 
<p> The images to the left are posters designed for a campaign on behalf of Massey University to increase the use of student services </p>

<h>App Design </h> 
    
<p>  During the Massey PR campaign, app design was something I was particularily interested in. The app needed to host all of our messaging in an effective and aesthetic way. I was only apart of designing the app, but would love to learn more about app programming and coding. </p>
